# Wine Dataset Analysis

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning model implementation on the Wine dataset. The goal is to analyze the dataset, train a classification model, and make predictions about wine classes based on their features.

## Dataset Overview

The Wine dataset contains data about different types of wines, classified into three categories. Each wine type is characterized by several numerical features, such as alcohol content, acidity, and flavonoids.

### Key Features

- **Number of Samples**: 178
- **Number of Features**: 13
- **Target Classes**: 3 (class_0, class_1, class_2)

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the dataset using Python libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
   - Visualize data distributions, correlations, and relationships between features.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Normalize features using StandardScaler for improved model performance.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree).
   - Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to predict wine classes for new samples.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Create visual representations such as heatmaps, pair plots, and feature importance charts.
